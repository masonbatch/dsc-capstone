    "Computing Vision (a made-up company for the purposes of this project) sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t have much background in creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office using different samples of available data. You then will translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Computing Vision's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.\n",

    "Our recommendations for this company will be based off of the Gross Margin which is portrayed as a percentage. The higher this percentage is the more the company is retaining for every dollar that is invested in the movie and as such is seeing a higher return on their investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Gross Margin = \\frac{Gross Revenue - Costs}{Gross Revenue} x 100$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important metric, especially for a company about to enter an industry they have no presence in because it will help show how far their money goes to create profit. The higher this percentage the better the business will be doing because it is an indicator that retains more on each dollar of sales to its costs. This metric also allows us to take a standardized approach to comparing movies and their success. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to investigate what a \"Good Movie\" i.e. a movie with a high Gross Margin is doing and try to emulate that. Thus we will explore the budget size, what directors are involved in those high margin films, and also what genres see the highest margin"
